4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Granular permissions separating Admins from standard Staff.
   - Secure server-side validation of all state mutations.

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
PEPPER_SECRET=your-secure-pepper-string
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key # Optional: For daily report emails
REPORT_RECIPIENTS=admin@example.com
```

### 2. Local Development

Install dependencies and start the local development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Production Deployment

This project is fully configured for Vercel.

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Set the **Framework Preset** to `TanStack Start` (or let Vercel auto-detect).
3. Ensure all environment variables from your `.env` are added to Vercel's Environment Variables settings.
4. Deploy. The custom build configuration natively generates the required `.vercel/output` edge structure.

## Architecture & Security

- **Server-Side Security:** Sensitive operations (like fetching daily reports or managing user roles) are securely gated behind server functions that verify the caller's IP, rate limit requests, and validate Supabase JWTs.
- **Error Boundaries:** The application implements robust React Error Boundaries combined with a custom telemetry reporter for unhandled exceptions.
- **PWA Ready:** The system operates offline via a registered Service Worker caching essential static assets.
